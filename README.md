# GWAS Study: Analysis of Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCL) mRNA Levels

## Introduction

Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are established through the transformation of peripheral B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Sie, et al.). LCLs are often used as surrogates for peripheral blood lymphocytes (Osorio, et al.) by researchers.

In this project, I performed GWAS analysis on the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) mRNA levels quantified through RNA sequencing from 4 different European populations. I also analyzed genotype and phenotype data by employing two different strategies: excluding covariates or including covariates with 50,000 of the SNP genotypes for 344 samples from the CEU (Utah residents with European ancestry), FIN (Finns), GBR (British) and, TSI (Toscani) population.

I am interested in studying if **population and gender** could cause the expression of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) mRNA levels to be different. Hereby, I want to raise my research question: Would population and gender as covariates influence the GWAS analysis result?

## Methods

## Discussion

There are some possible further research that we can carry out in the future. For example, we can refer to UCSC genome browser for nucleotide/codon letters and then hypothesize the mRNA levels. This will require a lot of biochemistry backgrounds.

## Conclusion

I found no significant change before or after including covariates. In my data analysis, **Population and Gender** as covariates do not seem to impact the GWAS analysis result significantly.
